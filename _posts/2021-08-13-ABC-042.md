So Coders i came here after a while, now i am way more determined to continue giving a contest on each day. 
Currently the plan is to give Atcoder beginner's contest daily and One codefroces round side by side.

About the contest:-

Q1 and Q2 were pretty easy and very small constraints made them even sillier.

Q3 was an implementation question on strings/array which i could have solved faster. It took me some time to code but at the end i solved it.

Q4 was purely maths based and required knowledge of PnC. Solved it very fast though.

Solved all 4 question today,pretty nice confidence booster on day 1..
Bye ! See ya !
