A bad day. I firstly did the mistake of presuming the contest to be tough. I was thinking too much for simple question too.Two easy question with simple maths and 3rd was dp.
Rest i was not able to look upto due to extra time which i spent on 3rd question.I could have solved 4th one given i did not waste my time on 3rd.I learned one thing today that some question just require you to hang in there for some time and keep solving. I literally gave up that i could solve 3rd, but then i backed myself and boom there i go. The results were less than my expectation, which is higher than burj khalifa(pun intended), but i'll keep solving...cheers

About the contest:-

"SOLVED"

1.Fair Playoff:- Cakewalk,just misread the size of array to be different. Pretty easy question which had some game format and rules on which teams will compete. It wanted to know if two best teams will compete in final or not.

2.Array Reodering:- I was too childish to make a wild guess before understanding the question completely. I didn't even read the question at first and submitted some wild algorithm and obviously A big WA punching me in the face.Use the basic fact of odd even numbers and gcd followed by Simplemath.

3.Unstable String:- easy-medium question for Dp. given a binary string with some '?' inserted. a string is called unstable if it had alternate 0 and 1. so it asked for number of possible unstable string thant can be formed by replacing ?. At first i tried to fix '?' with 1 or 0 and tried to find maximum using any one permutation only. But later i found that it meant to replace the '?' once the substring is selected and it will be again become '?'. it had pretty easy dp implementation with minimal corner cases.
dp[i] = 1 + (dependent on last character and current character)
