Virtual contest
A contest after a long time. This time its biweekly contest round 53. I was bit busy with hackathon 
project work and it ended yesterday only.So I hope to give a contest daily from now onwards.

About the contest:-
"SOLVED"

1.Substrings of Size Three with Distinct Characters:- Pretty easy question due to the very small contraints.
There are similar question i guess with higher limits. for ex- number of substrings/subsequence with 
k/all distinct character.

Tags:- Strings  Easy  dp(for its variation with higher constraints)

2.Minimize Maximum Pair Sum in Array:- Again a cakewalk with small constraints.I sorted the array and 
took sum of ith and n-i-1 element.

Tags:- Sorting  Medium
 
4.Minimum XOR Sum of Two Arrays:- Given two arrays find xor sum ie. Summation of(a[i] ^ b[i]).
Constraints:- n<=14 (Brute force may require 14! operations,TLE);
Optimizing brute force :- Try to memoize the ith element of b XORed with a using bitmasking and recursively
store the results.

Tags:- Dp with bitmasking  Hard

"UNSOLVED"
3.Get Biggest Three Rhombus Sums in a Grid:- Constraints were small so it just needed some implementation.
i was getting some error in implementation

Tags:- Implementation Medium


 I''ll comeback after upsolving...cheers
