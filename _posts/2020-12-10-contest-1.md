A tough one !!
Hey folks..First day went pretty bad. But first day of what?
So ya, I have decided to give a contest daily on cf.Lets see how much i develop
with this. I dont know why i am writing this blog, but just learned jekyll so
thought of posting something. 

About the contest:- 
1.First one was a cakewalk, AVOID TRYGUB, simply permuting the string to avoid any
  subsequence named 'trygub'.

2.A tricky one with only two answers possible, Ball of steels. The title was pretty funny 
  reminded me of johnny english. Anyways a geometry based question with a simple trick.
  We had to check if we can bring all points to single point with some manhattan constraints.
  n^2 solution worked.
  
3.Errich-tac-toe:- It was pretty tough for me,couldn't come up with a solution. The question asked if 
i could remove the winning condition from the grid. I was thinking in the right direction for sometime
but i guess a wrong step taken by me in one of my testcases made me think the idea to be incorrect.
Then i tried something sort of relaxation technique, rechecking again again if constraints are fulfilled 
and selected some ill placed "X". It worked correct on paper but had some anamoly.Couldnt figure it out.

4....5....and so on.

so Hard day, Would upsolve question D after this. Rating compression.

See ya after upsolving it.
