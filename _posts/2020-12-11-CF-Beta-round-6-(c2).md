Resultt !!
Hey folks..back again with another contest.I thought of giving the contest in an order now.
So i gave a pretty old contest today. Less than 1500 people participated in that and today 
they are mostly orange,red...everday i think i could have born earlier to become red today 
like them but i forget i could do this today as well.lol. Anyways a mediocre contest, 
happy to implement segment tree in the last question, although still not able to hadle 
the corner cases.

About the contest:- 
1.Triangle: Cakewalk,simply sorted and did atq;

2.President office: It was an overkill for me trying to run bfs on it,later implemented a simple one.
  
3.Alice bob and chocolate: two pointer ,easy question ,tricky implementation at first but later found an 
  easy method to implement.

4.Lizard and bombarment: Tough one for me,3d dp question,saw an editorial didn't understand it anyways XD.
  i think some easy method would be there, will ask someone regarding it.

5.Exposition: a segment tree question with binary search for a perfect r which shows monotonic behavior
 i aint able to handle the corner cases as of now..will update after upsolving if was able to do it or not.
 
 Title and content didnt match isn't it.Actually my 3rd sem results came today. so it was quite satisfying,
 procastinated throughout the contest,whole day instead. Overall cpi now updates to 9.33 phewwww...

 Coding ninja results came today, pretty bad rank i guess 249 out of 20k people participated.not being modest but 
 could have done better in the last round.
 
 I''ll comeback after upsolving...cheers
