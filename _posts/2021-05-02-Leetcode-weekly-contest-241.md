This time its weekly contest round 241. Today's contest seemed mediocre with similar question from existing problemset.

About the contest:-

3.Finding Pairs With a Certain Sum:- Pretty nice question for Hashmap. Store frequency of each number and for each a[i] see if mp[sum-a[i]] exists...
Brute force :- Binary search for each element to check if sum - a[i] exists or not.

4.Number of Ways to Rearrange Sticks With K Sticks Visible:- I thought i saw this question somewhere else too. It was clearly a Dp question at first glance.  I thought i solved the question and i got the approach as well .However i saw its hints somewhere and got AC. I solved it first thorugh recursion and then converted it into dp.
